# two-sum

## 문제 설명

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


## 제한 사항

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^3
* -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
* -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
* **Only one valid answer exists.**
